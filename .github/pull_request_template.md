## PCI review checklist

<!-- heimdall_github_prtemplate:grc-pci_dss-2024-01-05 -->

- [ ] If applicable, I've documented a plan to revert these changes if they require more than reverting the pull request.

- [ ] If applicable, I've worked with GRC to document the impact of any changes to security controls.

  Examples of changes to controls include access controls, encryption, logging, etc.

- [ ] If applicable, I've worked with GRC to ensure compliance due to a significant change to the in-scope PCI environment.

  Examples include changes to operating systems, ports, protocols, services, cryptography-related components, PII processing code, etc.
